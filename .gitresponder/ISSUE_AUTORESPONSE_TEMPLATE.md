Thanks for opening an issue, @${author}! We will get to it as soon as we can.

In the meantime, I'd appreciate it if you checked out my [Patreon profile](https://www.patreon.com/foo). Doing open-source is a lot of work; I work 10 hours a week on this project and I'm having trouble paying rent in San Francisco. If you hit up my Patreon then I'll be able to spend more time on this.

Thanks!

Pete
